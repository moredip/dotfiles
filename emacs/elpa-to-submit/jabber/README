GNU Emacs
=========

jabber.el depends on GNU Emacs 21, in particular xml.el, and some
files from Gnus 5.10.  If you don't have Gnus 5.10 (M-x gnus-version
will tell), you can download sha1.el and hex-util.el from Gnus CVS
at http://quimby.gnus.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/gnus/lisp/ .  For your
convenience, these files are included in the tarball.

XEmacs
======

You need an XEmacs with Mule support, and recent versions of the gnus,
net-utils and mule-ucs packages.  jabber.el basically works on XEmacs,
but some features are missing (in particular mouse support).  Testing
and patches are very welcome.

SASL
====
jabber.el will use the SASL library of FLIM (Faithful Library about
Internet Message; it is also included in newer versions of Gnus) if
it's present.  If not, it will fall back to JEP-0077 authentication.

TLS/SSL
=======
To get an encrypted connection, you need either tls.el (from Gnus) or
ssl.el.  These are interfaces to GnuTLS and OpenSSL, respectively; use
the appropriate one.  Recent versions of tls.el support both programs,
though.  The version of ssl.el distributed with Gnus is outdated; use
the one from W3 CVS instead:
http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewcvs/w3/lisp/ssl.el?root=w3

To actually use encryption, customize the variables
jabber-connection-type and jabber-connection-ssl-program.

Note that only the connection from you to the server is encrypted;
there is no guarantee of other connections being encrypted.

StartTLS is not supported in this version of jabber.el.

Installation
============
To install, put all .el files somewhere in your load-path (or have
your load-path include the directory they're in) and put
(require 'jabber) in your .emacs file.  To install the Info
documentation, copy jabber.info to /usr/local/info and run
"install-info /usr/local/info/jabber.info".

If you've been using a post-0.6 CVS version of jabber.el, you might
need to remove some redundant hook functions.  Make sure that
jabber-alert-message-hooks doesn't contain jabber-message-history, and
that jabber-alert-presence-hooks doesn't contain
jabber-presence-watch.

Usage
=====
To start using it, type M-x jabber-customize and set your username and
server.  Then, type C-x C-j C-c (or equivalently M-x jabber-connect)
to connect (with prefix argument, register new account).

Your roster is displayed in a buffer called *-jabber-*.  To
disconnect, type C-x C-j C-d or M-x jabber-disconnect.

You may want to use the menu bar to execute Jabber commands.  To
enable the Jabber menu, type M-x jabber-menu.

For a less terse description, read the enclosed manual.

For bug reports, help requests and other feedback, use the trackers
and forums at the project page mentioned above.

Configuration
=============
All available configuration options are described in the manual.  This
section only serves to point out the most important ones.

To change how you are notified about incoming events, type M-x
customize-group RET jabber-alerts.

To activate logging of all chats, set jabber-history-enabled to t.  By
default, history will be saved in ~/.jabber_global_message_log; make
sure that this file has appropriate permissions.  Type M-x
customize-group RET jabber-history for more options.

By default, jabber.el will send a confirmation when messages sent to
you are delivered and displayed, and also send "contact is typing"
notifications.  To change this, type M-x customize-group RET
jabber-events, and set the three jabber-events-confirm-* variables to
nil.

File transfer
=============
This release of jabber.el contains experimental support for file
transfer.  It is not enabled by default.  See the file
filetransfer.txt for details.
